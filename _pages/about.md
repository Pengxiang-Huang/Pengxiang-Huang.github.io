About Me
======
Hi there. I’m Pengxiang Huang, a Master’s student at Northwestern University, in Electrical and Computer Engineering department. 

I’m currently working on enhancing quantum circuit simulations by leveraging lightweight staging for tensor optimization, 
aiming to exploit the structural sparsity in quantum computations, advised by [Prof. Guannan Wei](https://continuation.passing.style/).

Previously, I was honored to collaborated with [Prof. Simone Campanoni](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~simonec/#gsc.tab=0) in Northwestern 
on building and enhancing program analysis infrastructure [NOELLE](https://github.com/arcana-lab/noelle?tab=readme-ov-file) upon LLVM. 
I also worked with [Prof. Kangjie Lu](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~kjlu/) in University of Minnesota on developing [APILOT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16526) to secure the code generation
by language models. 



**I’m actively looking for Ph.D opportunities in 2025 Fall.** Here is my complete [CV](http://pengxiang-huang.github.io/files//Users/demario/Documents/Profile_Website/files/CV_Pengxiang_Huang.pdf).  
Please get in touch if you are intertested!
