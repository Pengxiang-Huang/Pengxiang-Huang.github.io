About Me
======
Hi there. I‚Äôm Pengxiang Huang, I am a Ph.D. student at University of Rochester in the department of Computer Science, advised by [Prof. John Criswell](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/criswell/index.html)

I am broadly interested in program analysis, and my recent research intersects with compilers, security, operating systems, software engineering, and artificial intelligence.

Previously, I was honored to collaborated with [Prof. Simone Campanoni](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~simonec/#gsc.tab=0) in Northwestern 
on building and improving program analysis infrastructure [NOELLE](https://github.com/arcana-lab/noelle?tab=readme-ov-file) upon LLVM. 
I also worked with [Prof. Kangjie Lu](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~kjlu/) in University of Minnesota on developing [APILOT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16526) to secure the code generation
by language models.
