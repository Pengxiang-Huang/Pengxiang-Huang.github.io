About Me
======
Hi there. I‚Äôm Pengxiang Huang, a Master‚Äôs student at Northwestern University, in Electrical and Computer Engineering department. 

I am broadly interested in program analysis, and my recent research intersects with compilers, security, software engineering and programming languages. 

I‚Äôm currently working on enhancing quantum circuit simulations by leveraging lightweight staging for tensor optimization, 
aiming to exploit the structural sparsity in quantum computations, advised by [Prof. Guannan Wei](https://continuation.passing.style/).

Previously, I was honored to collaborated with [Prof. Simone Campanoni](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~simonec/#gsc.tab=0) in Northwestern 
on building and improving program analysis infrastructure [NOELLE](https://github.com/arcana-lab/noelle?tab=readme-ov-file) upon LLVM. 
I also worked with [Prof. Kangjie Lu](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~kjlu/) in University of Minnesota on developing [APILOT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16526) to secure the code generation
by language models. 

More details about my projects are [here](http://pengxiang-huang.github.io/markdown). 

**I‚Äôm actively looking for Ph.D opportunities in 2025 Fall.** Here is my [CV](http://pengxiang-huang.github.io/files/CV_Pengxiang_Huang.pdf), 
please get in touch if you are intertested!
